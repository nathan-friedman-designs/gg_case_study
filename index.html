            Our project started by collecting user data through interviews. In an effort to generate more data faster, our team also opened a digital survey to the public through social media.

            The survey response made it seem that our client had a vast, potential customer base-- if they could keep it. The data we collected from the interviews suggested that poor accessibility, confusing interactivity, and broken navigation were restricting the user's ability to engage with the organization, threatening the non-profit's reach and placing its future operations into question.

            We conducted a competitor analysis to see how other gardening non-profits fared in their designs, and identify points to take advantage of in our upcoming work. Gardopia Gardens was stronger than others in calling its users to volunteer, but fell behind in its nonresponsive design and poor accessibility. While it joined its competitors in featuring community programs and calling users to donate, it also suffered from similarly poor interactivity. With all this data in hand, our next step was to humanize our research and have a face to our target user.

            Xavier Salazar is a 21-year-old college student frightened from having found out he’s pre-diabetic. Pained to see his parents struggle with diabetes, he’s desperate to maintain a healthy lifestyle, especially one that can incorporate social interaction. Yet his efforts are threatened by the fast-food-only options on campus, and the demands placed on him by his busy school schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
            Altogether, we concluded from the data analysis that frightened college students needed to connect with their food sources because they wanted to experience a full, independent life, free of chronic illness. Our team decided to assist by reassembling the site's content and revamping its style to attract more traffic to the site, and that we might be able to help if we focused on a user-centered, mobile-first approach to redesigning the site.

      Another tool we used to aid us in our design was the UI style guide. We kept in mind the results of our competitor analysis, while focusing our UI elements on keeping the UX design efficient, and promoting the organization’s values through the site’s aesthetics. To assist the users along their path, we chose images that would reflect the services the site provided, and a typography that made it simple for the user to understand the content.

    <p>
      From our mid-fidelity to high-fidelity prototypes, we engaged in user testing with 10 different users. The feedback we received was analyzed through a user priority matrix, which we applied to our responsive high-fidelity prototypes. As part of our user-centered design approach, it was critical to our team that the users enjoyed a seamless experience switching between mobile view and desktop view.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among the data we gathered, we discovered that 80% of our users preferred using mobile devices for day-to-day reading and browsing. This helped us in deciding to implement a mobile-first approach to our final design. The design itself went through four iterations, adjusting based on feedback from users. Among the elements incorporated into the final prototype were a responsive layout between mobile and desktop views (to avoid user confusion between view-switching), and simplistic elements for content clarity.

    <p>
      A center feature of our design was a module for skill matching to assist veterans in transferring military skills to civilian work and therefore helping ease their transition into civilian life. This module included a questionnaire users would fill out regarding their experience in different fields of knowledge, which would provide the data to match jobs to the strongest skills. To further support this transition effort, we also included listings with pre-filtered jobs and apprenticeship programs, as well as resume assistance.

        We also included a hero section with attractive images of inviting scenes, to promote the mission of the National Veterans Outreach.

        In the footer, the link to the Veterans Crisis Line was displayed prominently alongside other important links, as well as a chart demonstrating the organization’s allocation of assets to encourage user trust and subsequent donations.

      <p>
        In the end, a last round of testing demonstrated that users enjoyed the experience of the redesigned website. Not only did this validate our efforts, but, most importantly, it meant that we had a stronger alternative to the current site design, one that could offer better assistance in easing the transition to civilian life for returning veterans: our users.
