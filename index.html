                Some of our veterans struggle to get resources on finding new career paths, receiving housing assistance, and generally coexisting in civilian life. Non-profit organizations like the National Veterans Outreach were born to bridge this gap.

                However, our team found that its outdated site model had a chance of frustrating veterans instead. We decided to plant our flag there, and rework the NVO’s content framework to create a website design that made veterans feel confident in finding the services that they needed.

            The data we collected from the interviews suggested that veterans tended to rely on their friends and fellow veterans to connect them to resources, primarily to avoid the hassles and stigma that would face them if they went through other, traditional paths.
          </p>

          <p>
            We also found that for returning veterans, underemployment was one of the toughest obstacles they faced. Veterans were often pushed toward working in low-skill jobs, even though their training gave them the foundations to handle better work. After all, skills learned in the military didn’t always transfer well to private-sector work. That being said, a majority of veterans transitioning to the civilian life wanted to do something different from their military roles. Without a clear path to follow, they found themselves hindered from developing their technical and essential skills.

          <p>
            To assist in rounding out our research, we reviewed some of the organizations competing with the National Veterans Outreach. A few of the non-profits we observed were the Soldiers’ Angels, Hope for the Warriors, and The American Legion. For the most part, these groups covered essential points in helping veterans, including discussing employment, housing assistance, and health care. However, we found an opportunity to make the NVO stand out by turning its website into one more desirable and easy to use than the others.

        <p>
            Altogether, our research assisted us in realizing that disabled veterans needed an easier way to access their benefits because they didn’t want to overburden their friends and families in their transition to civilian life. We believed that, by modernizing the National Veterans Outreach's website design, disabled veterans would be able to access their benefits more easily, allowing the site to be a more effective resource for disabled veterans. These conclusions served to form the backbone of our user insight statement.

      Another tool we used to aid us in our design was the UI style guide. We kept in mind the results of our competitor analysis, while focusing our UI elements on keeping the UX design efficient, and promoting the organization’s values through the site’s aesthetics. To assist the users along their path, we chose images that would reflect the services the site provided, and a typography that made it simple for the user to understand the content.

    <p>
      From our mid-fidelity to high-fidelity prototypes, we engaged in user testing with 10 different users. The feedback we received was analyzed through a user priority matrix, which we applied to our responsive high-fidelity prototypes. As part of our user-centered design approach, it was critical to our team that the users enjoyed a seamless experience switching between mobile view and desktop view.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among the data we gathered, we discovered that 80% of our users preferred using mobile devices for day-to-day reading and browsing. This helped us in deciding to implement a mobile-first approach to our final design. The design itself went through four iterations, adjusting based on feedback from users. Among the elements incorporated into the final prototype were a responsive layout between mobile and desktop views (to avoid user confusion between view-switching), and simplistic elements for content clarity.

    <p>
      A center feature of our design was a module for skill matching to assist veterans in transferring military skills to civilian work and therefore helping ease their transition into civilian life. This module included a questionnaire users would fill out regarding their experience in different fields of knowledge, which would provide the data to match jobs to the strongest skills. To further support this transition effort, we also included listings with pre-filtered jobs and apprenticeship programs, as well as resume assistance.

        We also included a hero section with attractive images of inviting scenes, to promote the mission of the National Veterans Outreach.

        In the footer, the link to the Veterans Crisis Line was displayed prominently alongside other important links, as well as a chart demonstrating the organization’s allocation of assets to encourage user trust and subsequent donations.

      <p>
        In the end, a last round of testing demonstrated that users enjoyed the experience of the redesigned website. Not only did this validate our efforts, but, most importantly, it meant that we had a stronger alternative to the current site design, one that could offer better assistance in easing the transition to civilian life for returning veterans: our users.
